A repository containing a few fixes for various things that annoy me in the discord web/desktop client.

## Themes
* [NitroUpsellBegone](NitroUpsellBegone/README.md) - removes discord's pathetic attempts at trying to get you to buy nitro
* more coming soon (hopefully, maybe)

## How to Use
### Common instructions
> [!NOTE]
> All these themes are only tested on Vencord, so they haven't been verified to work anywhere else.
> Also the instructions for other mods might be out of date.

1. Navigate to the theme's README file
2. Select the URL(s) for the theme/modules you want to use
3. Copy the URL(s)

### Vencord
4. Open the **Themes** tab in vencord settings
5. Switch to the **Online Themes** tab
6. Paste the URL(s) on a new line in the box

### Replugged
4. Go to the **Quick CSS** section in replugged settings
5. Wrap each URL in an @import statement and paste it at the top of the CSS box

```css
@import "https://evilsquirrelguy.github.io/MicroThemes/ThemeName/index.css";
```

### Other Mods
idk how other mods work, but you should be able to use the Quick CSS method on any client mod

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions feel free to put them in an issue or make a PR for it, i'll try to have a look at it.
If you're making a PR, bear in mind that all the selectors try to be resilient to discord chanding the random series
of letters and numbers after each class name/id, so try to use the `[class^="xyz" i]` syntax instead of `.xyz-abc123`.

## Known Issues
Some selectors are tied to `aria-label`, this is not ideal as this value changes depending on your discord language.
I've tried to make any selectors that use this as generic as possible but if your language does something different
then you're out of luck. If you need this fixed, create an issue with the full value of the offending element's
`aria-label` attribute, or if you manage to figure out a better way, that's also welcome.
